# üí´ About Me:
I'm currently in my third year of college at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus <br>
pursuing a Bachelor's in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and <br>
a Master's in Physics.<br>
I'm particularly interested in Computer Vision, particularly generative <br>
architectures such as diffusion models and their variants.<br>
I am interested in going deeper into the application of LLMs and Vision in <br>
a wide variety of domains such as Medical Imagery and Autonomous Driving <br>
Apart from this, I like designing Agentic AI workflows and exploring<br>
image generation with ComfyUI
